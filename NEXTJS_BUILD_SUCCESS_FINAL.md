# üéâ NEXT.JS BUILD SUCCESS - FINAL RESOLUTION!

## ‚úÖ **BUILD ERROR COMPLETELY FIXED**

Your fantasy football app is now properly configured for Next.js and will build successfully on Vercel!

---

## üîß **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Added "use client" Directive**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Fixed: app/page.tsx now starts with:
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
// ... rest of component
```

**Why this was needed:**
- **Next.js 14 App Router** uses Server Components by default
- **Server Components** can't use client-side hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, event handlers
- **Client Components** need the `"use client"` directive to run in the browser
- **Your app uses `useState`** so it must be a Client Component

### **2. Fixed next.config.js**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Before (deprecated warning)
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,  // ‚Üê This caused the warning
  },
}

// ‚úÖ After (clean config)
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    domains: ['images.unsplash.com'],
  },
}
```

**Why this was fixed:**
- **`experimental.appDir`** is deprecated in Next.js 14
- **App Router is stable** and enabled by default
- **Removed warning** that was cluttering build logs
