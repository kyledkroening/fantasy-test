# üèà How to Run Your Fantasy Football App - Super Simple Guide

**Don't worry!** This guide assumes you've never done anything like this before. Just follow each step exactly as written.

## üéØ What We're Doing
We're going to make your fantasy football website work on your computer so you can see it in your web browser. Think of it like installing a game, but for a website.

---

## Step 1: Install Node.js (The Engine)
Node.js is like the engine that makes your website run. You only need to do this once.

### For Windows:
1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org
2. **Click the big green button** that says "Download Node.js" (it will pick the right version)
3. **Run the downloaded file** (it's probably in your Downloads folder)
4. **Click "Next" through all the steps** - the default settings are perfect
5. **Restart your computer** when it's done

### For Mac:
1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org
2. **Click the big green button** that says "Download Node.js"
3. **Open the downloaded file** and drag Node.js to your Applications folder
4. **Restart your computer**

### How to Check if it Worked:
Don't worry about this step if you're nervous - we'll find out if it worked in the next steps!

## Step 2: Get Your Fantasy Football App Files
You need all the app files on your computer. There are two ways to do this:

### Option A: Download as ZIP (Easiest)
1. **Find where your app files are** (GitHub, email, USB drive, etc.)
2. **Download them as a ZIP file**
3. **Right-click the ZIP file** and choose "Extract All" (Windows) or double-click it (Mac)
4. **Remember where you put the folder** - you'll need to find it again!
   - Good places: Desktop, Documents folder
   - Bad places: Downloads folder (hard to find later)

### Option B: If Someone Gave You a Folder
Just make sure it's somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop or Documents folder.

## Step 3: Open the Magic Box (Terminal/Command Prompt)
This is where we type commands to make things happen. Don't worry - we'll only type a few simple things!

### For Windows:
1. **Press the Windows key** (‚äû) on your keyboard
2. **Type**: `cmd`
3. **Press Enter**
4. A black box will appear - this is your "Command Prompt"

### For Mac:
1. **Press Command + Space** (‚åò + Space)
2. **Type**: `terminal`
3. **Press Enter**
4. A black box will appear - this is your "Terminal"

### What You'll See:
A black (or white) box with some text and a blinking cursor. This is normal! It's waiting for you to tell it what to do.

---

## Step 4: Navigate to Your App Folder
We need to tell the computer where your fantasy football app is located.

### The Easy Way:
1. **Open a file explorer window** (Windows) or **Finder** (Mac)
2. **Find your fantasy football app folder** (the one with all the files)
3. **Look at the address bar** at the top - it shows the path (like `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\fantasy-app`)
4. **Copy that path** (Ctrl+C on Windows, Cmd+C on Mac)

### In Your Terminal/Command Prompt:
1. **Type**: `cd ` (that's "cd" followed by a space)
2. **Paste the path** you copied (Ctrl+V on Windows, Cmd+V on Mac)
3. **Press Enter**

**Example:**
```
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\fantasy-app
```
or
```
cd /Users/YourName/Desktop/fantasy-app
```

### How to Tell if it Worked:
The text in your terminal should now show your app folder name somewhere in it.

## Step 5: Install the App Parts (Dependencies)
Your app needs some extra pieces to work. We'll download them automatically.

### In Your Terminal/Command Prompt:
1. **Type exactly**: `npm install`
2. **Press Enter**
3. **Wait** - you'll see lots of text scrolling by. This is normal!
4. **Wait some more** - this can take 2-5 minutes
5. **You're done when** you see a new line with a cursor waiting for you

### What You'll See:
Lots of text that looks like gibberish. Don't worry about it! The computer is downloading and setting up everything your app needs.

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- **Make sure you're in the right folder** (Step 4)
- **Make sure Node.js is installed** (Step 1)
- **Try closing and reopening your terminal**

---

## Step 6: Start Your Fantasy Football App! üöÄ

### In Your Terminal/Command Prompt:
1. **Type exactly**: `npm run dev`
2. **Press Enter**
3. **Wait** for about 10-30 seconds
4. **Look for a message** that says something like:
   ```
   ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

### This Means Success! üéâ
Your app is now running on your computer!

---

## Step 7: See Your App in Action
1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - any will work)
2. **Type in the address bar**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **üéâ Your fantasy football app should appear!**

---

## üéØ You're Done! What Now?

### Explore Your App:
- Click on all the different tabs (Dashboard, Standings, Championships, etc.)
- Everything you see is working with sample data from your league
- Try adding a new data source in the "Management" tab

### To Stop the App:
- **Go back to your terminal**
- **Press Ctrl+C** (Windows) or **Cmd+C** (Mac)
- The app will stop running

### To Start it Again Later:
1. **Open terminal again**
2. **Navigate to your app folder** (Step 4)
3. **Type**: `npm run dev`
4. **Open browser to**: `http://localhost:3000`

## üÜò Help! Something Went Wrong!

### "Command not found" or "npm is not recognized"
- **Problem**: Node.js isn't installed properly
- **Solution**: Go back to Step 1 and reinstall Node.js, then restart your computer

### "Cannot find package.json"
- **Problem**: You're not in the right folder
- **Solution**: Make sure you're in the fantasy football app folder (Step 4)

### "Port 3000 is already in use"
- **Problem**: The app is already running somewhere else
- **Solution**: Try `http://localhost:3001` in your browser, or restart your computer

### The Website Shows an Error
- **Problem**: Something went wrong with the code
- **Solution**: Make sure all files were downloaded correctly, try the `npm install` step again

### Nothing Happens When I Type Commands
- **Problem**: Terminal might be frozen
- **Solution**: Close the terminal window and open a new one, start over from Step 3

### Still Stuck?
1. **Take a screenshot** of what you're seeing
2. **Note exactly which step you're on**
3. **Ask for help** and share the screenshot
